# GMT320-assignment-2
For this assignment, I created an online web application dashboard that visualises the mobility trend data during Covid-19 2022.
The data was derived Google(tm)'s community mobility reports.
This particular application focuses on the following provinces such as Eastern Cape, Free State, Gauteng, KZN, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, North West, Northern Cape, Western Cape and locational catergories such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacy, workplaces and residential areas.
The application is interactive and lets the user to choose between view the mobility trends per province or per locational category.

Chart.js was the JavaScript chart library used to create the charts and allow the interactivity feature to exist.
The web pages were created using HTML5 and CSS.
